    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated
        fowl.
        Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male may be called a cockerel; a male that has been
        castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special
        ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BCE).[1][2] Humans
        now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as
        pets.</p>

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>According to Merriam-Webster, the term "rooster" (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th
        century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English "cock",[20][21][22] and is widely
        used throughout North America. "Roosting" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night, which is done by
        both sexes.
